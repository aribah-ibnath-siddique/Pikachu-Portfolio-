   <h2 class="title">Pikachu Throughout the journey with Ash Ketchum</h2> <h4 class="date"><i>July 14, 2024</i></h4> <p id= "grad">Everyone has heard of the iconic duo Ash Ketchum from Pallet Town and Pikachu from Professor Oak’s laboratory. Together, the ultimate dream they shared was for Ash to become a Pokémon master. It seemed like a naïve dream when Ash began his journey and lost innumerable amounts of battles, but he ultimately proved many wrong. They finally achieved their dreams after nearly two decades, following the conclusion of “Pokémon Journeys.” The producers were sure to make their last moments in the final episodes extremely emotional for those that have grown up with Ash.
